# Recipes website using HTML

The purpose of this very first The Odin Project project is to get some practice with HTML basics: using a couple of basic tags, making a website so that you can navigate between pages (and between files in filesystem).

Since it is the first actual project of the TOP, I'm required to use Git. This is a Great opportunity to get more familiar with atomic commits and Conventional commits and to get comfortable with committing early and often.
