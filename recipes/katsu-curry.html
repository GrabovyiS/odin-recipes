    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Katsu curry is a Japanese dish consisting of a pork cutlet served with a portion 
      of Japanese rice and curry. It is served on a large plate and is typically eaten 
      using a spoon or fork. The cutlet is usually precut into strips, eliminating the 
      need for a knife.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
      <li>2 large chicken breasts</li>
      <li>400ml milk</li>
      <li>100g plain flour</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li> 
      <li>150g panko breadcrumbs or coarse dried breadcrumbs</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>
        Cut each chicken breast in half lengthways, creating four fillets. Put each 
        fillet between two sheets of baking parchment and beat with a rolling pin 
        to even out the thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the milk into a bowl and season with a large pinch of salt, then add 
        the chicken fillets. Cover and leave in the fridge for at least 20 mins 
        or for up to 24 hrs (the longer you leave the chicken in the milk, the 
        more succulent it will be).
      </li>
      <li>
        When youâ€™re ready to coat the chicken, tip the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs
        into three separate bowls, then season the flour with the togarashi and 
        stir the soy sauce into the eggs. Scoop one chicken fillet out of the milk
        and coat in the flour mix, then dip into the egg mix and coat in the 
        breadcrumbs. Set on a plate and repeat with the rest of the chicken fillets. 
        Can be prepared up to a day ahead and frozen for up to a month.
      </li>

        To cook the katsu, heat a good layer of oil in a large frying pan, then 
        add as many of the chicken fillets as you can fit and fry for 3-4 mins 
        on each side until deep golden and crisp. Transfer to a tray and keep 
        warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining fillets.
