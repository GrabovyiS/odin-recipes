    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Borscht is a sour soup, made with meat stock, vegetables and seasonings, 
      common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word "borscht"
      is most often associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, 
      made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give 
      the dish its distinctive red color.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
      <li>
        1 (1 1/4 pound) section bone-in beef shank with a lot of meat, 
        or 1 pound beef stew meat, excess fat trimmed
      </li>
      <li>
        1 large onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
      </li>
      <li>
        8 cups beef broth or beef stock, divided
      </li>
      <li>
        4 large beets (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and chopped
      </li>
      <li>
        4 carrots (1 pound), peeled and chopped
      </li>
      <li>
        1 large russet potato (6 ounces), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
      </li>
      <li>
        2 cups thinly sliced cabbage
      </li>
      <li>
        3/4 cup chopped fresh dill, divided
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>
        Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. 
        Add the shank slice or stew beef. Let the beef brown lightly on one side, 
        then turn over. Add the chopped onions to the pot. Let the onions cook 
        and soften, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring 
        to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is 
        falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. 
        Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and 
        spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan. 
        Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Toss the potatoes with olive 
        oil and make room for them in the roasting pan, and roast everything 
        an additional 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, 
        and take the pot off the heat. If you are using a beef shank, remove 
        and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the 
        meat into bite sized pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, 
        beets, and potato. Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, 
        and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 
        another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.
      </li>
    </ol>
